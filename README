* Script Name: MinePi Installer Script
* Version: 0.1.1 (Minecraft Edition)
* By: Lance Seidman (@LanceSeidman) <http://lance.compulsivetech.biz> 
*
* Description: This was designed to help Raspberry Pi users to easily download
* and extract the Minecraft Archive. It also offers the ability to Resume bro-
* ken downloads that may happen if something happens to the Pi but also will 
* make a refrence to the Minecraft launcher so that the Pi user can just type
* minecraft in a Bash Terminal.
*
* Education Purpose: Beyond making a easy to use autorun script, I hope the Pi
* users will read the source to the small script and hopefully with the easy
* to understand comments and the way it was written, they can maybe learn how
* to make installers for his/her future development projects. In the spirit of
* open source, this is really a way to catch the attention of a younger group
* or even an older set of people to get them in to programming.
*
* License: In the spirit of supporting Aaron Swartz, this is obviously CC &
* is OPEN to the world. Do what you want to it, make changes or learn from it.
* The very least, make simple changes for your own personal use.
*
* No Raspberry Pi? Get & Learn: I highly recommend EVERYONE who's not a technical
* person to obtain a Pi and help support Eben and his Team/Organization. We need
* radical change and to get everyone more in to science.
*
* * Buy a Pi: I recommend visiting http://downloads.element14.com/raspberryPi1.html
*
* * Pi Addons/Hack-A-Pi: I can't strongly enough recommend AdaFruit. LadyAda is a
* * HUGE reason I personally have gotten in to electronics. They also run a weekly
* * show called Show and Tell where YOU can show your current projects and also
* * Ask an Engineer for any help you may need with Phil! Talk about fun!
* 
* HOWTO Launch Script
*
* *  Open a Terminal on the Pi in GUI (Graphical)
* *  1). Click the 'Menu' button on the bottom left corner.
* *  2). Move your mouse up to "Accessories" and when presented, click LXTerminal.
*
* *  In your terminal, locate the script you downloaded (ls to view directory files)
* *  You found the script? Good job!
* *  Now type or copy: ./mine-pi and press enter on your keyboard & use the Menu.
*
* *  Note: You don't need sudo because using LXTermainl (if in GUI) you're root..
* *  If you're using SSH & remotely connecting, you can't launch Minecraft BUT
* *  you will be able to run the script to download, and install/setup.
* *
* *  Tip: If you don't have chmod 775 set, you may not be able to launch it. Also
* *  you'll use sudo if you're in a remote connection (means not at the Pi or VNC)
